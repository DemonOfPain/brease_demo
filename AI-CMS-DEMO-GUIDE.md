### File Structure
```
/src/components/
  /assistant/
    AISidebar.tsx         # Main sidebar (420px wide)
  /demo/
    DemoChat.tsx          # Chat interface
    DemoPreviewModal.tsx  # Preview modal (z-index: 10000)
    DemoSearchResults.tsx # Search with semantic matching
    DemoDocumentUpload.tsx # Document processing
    DemoPageRename.tsx    # Page renaming
    DemoScriptEmbed.tsx   # Script embedding
/src/lib/
  mockData.ts            # Centralized demo data store
```

### Mock Data

- 3 initial pages (Home, Team, Contact)
- Company Profile page created during demo
- All changes persist in memory during session

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
If port 3000 is busy, the app will try 3001, then 3002. Check console output for actual port.

### Preview Modal Position
The modal uses React Portal to render at document.body level, ensuring it appears centered regardless of sidebar state.

### Content Overflow
All components use proper width constraints:
- Messages: max-w-[85%] with break-words
- Components: w-full with overflow-x-auto
- Search results: truncate with proper flex-shrink
